  <H1> Did someone say TURKISH DELIGHT?!!??!?!</H1>


<img src="./Photos/blabla.jpg" alt="Picture of Turkish Delight" style="width: 500px; ">
<p>Here's a recipe for Turkish delight.</p>

<p> List of ingredients needed: </p>



<ul>
  <li> flavourless oil for the tray </li>
  <li>500g granulated sugar</li>
  <li>½ tsp cream of tartar</li>
  <li>120g cornflour, plus extra for dusting</li>
  <li> ½ tsp rosewater (or 2 tbsp rose syrup)</li>
  <li> pink food colouring, if not using the rose syrup</li>
  <li> icing sugar, for dusting</li>
</ul>


<p> <h3> Method </h3></p>
<p> <h4>STEP 1</h4></p>

<p>Oil a shallow square metal or silicone baking tray, about 18 x 18cm.</p>
 <p> Put the sugar in a pan with the cream of tartar and 500ml water and heat gently at first,</p>
 <p> stirring so that the sugar melts. Then, turn up the heat and boil</p>
  <p>for 10-15 mins until the mixture is a little more syrupy.</p>
  <p>If you have a sugar thermometer, it should reach 115-118C.</p>

  <p><h3> STEP 2</h3></p>

  <p>Stir the cornflour into 150ml water, then, whisking all the time, </p>
  <p>pour it into the sugar syrup. Keep whisking, until everything combines to make a smooth,</p>
  <p>gloopy mix. Take out the whisk and start to stir with a spatula </p>
    <p> or spoon over a medium heat. Keep stirring until the mixture is </p>
      <p>thick enough to see a clear line drawn through it with the spoon</p>
        <p>and it starts to leave the sides of the pan. It will be very thick</p>
          <p>and make big bubbles that burst as it cooks, so be careful. </p>
            <p>This can take up to an hour. Test the mix by dropping a small </p>
              <p>amount into very cold water; it should form a ball that can be</p>
                <p>pressed gently when cold and that will feel a little springy.</p>

                <p> <h3> STEP 3</h3></p>
                <p>Stir in the rosewater or rose syrup and the food colouring,</p>
                <p> if using, then pour everything into the tray and level the top.</p>
                  <p> Leave to cool and set completely. Sieve some cornflour and icing</p>
                    <p> sugar together over a board and carefully turn out </p>
                      <p> the Turkish delight. Cover it with more icing sugar </p>
                        <p> and cornflour and cut it into cubes with a sharp knife.</p>
                          <p> Dust with yet more of the icing sugar mixture and move</p>
                            <p> the pieces apart so they can dry. Can be stored openly </p>
                              <p> or in small cardboard boxes or bags for up to 1 week.</p>

                              <p> <H2> ENJOY! </H2></p>
